            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>
            I am Frontend Developer capable of crafting Great User Experience.

            I constantly learn & experiment.

            I Like Sketch, draw mockups & build wireframes; I know some UX Design.

            I have build several web based & mobile applications. You can find them all on my [Github](https://github.com/andrew-h-lee/).

            I enjoy exploring new technology & make things easy for everyone. You can  find me experimenting with Ruby On Rails, ReactJS, JavaScript & more open source technologies.

            </p>
            <!--<p>
            I write blogs to articulate my thoughts; what's inside my brain.

            My tools of choice include Ruby On Rails, JavaScript, ReactJS, SASS.

            Must be able to demonstrate a passion for technology - you keep up with the latest patterns and frameworks through blogs, meet ups, user forums, conferences, repository account etc.

            Basic 'ABOUT ME' in terms of delivering my Distinct Value.
